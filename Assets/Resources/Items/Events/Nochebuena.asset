  itemTrivia: "The most beloved of all events of every Filipino actually traces its
    roots to the traditions of Spanish culture. Translated literally as \u201CGood
    Night,\u201D this event occurs during Christmas Eve where families gather and
    have a meal together in anticipation and celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.
    There is a usual host of multiple course meals, but in the Philippines, one would
    normally have Lechon as the centerpiece. "
