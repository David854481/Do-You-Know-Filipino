  itemTrivia: 'The Loi Krathong or the annual festival of lights in Thailand is one
    of the most anticipated events in their country. They either lift their worries
    via lanterns or floating them away in handmade lily pads with lighting. This
    tradition symbolizes thanking the goddess of water, and to worship Buddha as
    well. '
