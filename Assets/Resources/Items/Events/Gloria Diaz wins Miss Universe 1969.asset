  itemTrivia: "Marking the first of many wins for the Philippines, a Miss Universe
    crazed country, Ms. Gloria Diaz stunned the crowd and won the prestigious pageant
    coinciding with the Landing on the moon in 1969. The news of her win was broadcasted
    to the crew of Apollo 11, the crew that first landed on the moon. Her victory
    echoed with then US President Nixon to utter the line, \u201CAmerica has conquered
    the moon, but the Philippines conquered the universe.\u201D "
