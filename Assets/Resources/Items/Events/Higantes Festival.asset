  itemTrivia: "Angono, Rizal is known as the art capital of the Philippines, and
    according to Folklore, papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 art forms of giants were used by the
    locals to parade around as a protest to ward away the Spanish invaders and colonizers.
    Now, they are paraded around to honor the patron saint of Angono, San Clemente. "
