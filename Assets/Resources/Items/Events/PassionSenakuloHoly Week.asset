  itemTrivia: 'As with primary religious traditions that the Philippines has grown
    accustomed to, the Holy Week period is from the influence of the Catholic Church
    brought about during Spanish Colonization. Various activities that stem from
    catholicism have been altered however to Filipino traditions such as the Visita
    Iglesia or pilgrimage to 7 churches that symbolize the 14 stations of the cross
    that Jesus went through. '
