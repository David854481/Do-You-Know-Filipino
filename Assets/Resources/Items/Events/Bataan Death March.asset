  itemTrivia: 'The Bataan Death March was a forcible prisoner transfer during the
    Second World War, after the Fall of Bataan. Some 60,000 - 80,00 troops from both
    the Philippines and US were forced to march to a prisoner camp from Mariveles
    and Bagac, Bataan all the way to Capas, Tarlac in Central Luzon, an estimated
    whopping 110 kilometer forced march, with little to no food, constant beatings
    from the Japanese troops, which left numerous dead between 5,500 to 18,000 prisoners
    dying or escaping along the route. '
