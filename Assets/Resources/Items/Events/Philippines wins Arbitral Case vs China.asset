  itemCategory: 
  itemTrivia: 'With Manila and Beijing having been at long odds regarding sovereignty
    over the area of the West Philippine Sea (or South China Sea), the Philippines
    took to the courts in 2013 to debunk the outrageous Nine-Dash Line historical
    claim of China. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines
    in its territorial claims, and thus debunked the claim of China. The court ruled
    a historic win in 2016 for the Philippines and its sovereignty. '
