  itemTrivia: 'This particular tradition, thought very popular amongst Filipinos,
    is actually a tradition carried and brought to us by the Spanish. Catholics generally
    venerate their dead and celebrate their lives through prayer, although varying
    ways of veneration and festivities occur from different countries that were once
    colonies of the Kingdom of Spain. '
